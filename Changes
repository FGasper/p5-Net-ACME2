Revision history for Perl module Net::ACME2

0.21
- Acknowledge need for XS-based SSL functionality. This module can’t run
  “anywhere that Perl runs” because of this. :-(

0.2 19 Jun 2018
- BREAKING: poll_authorization() and poll_order() now return the object’s
new status rather than boolean and no longer throw an exception on an
unrecognized status.
- finalize_order() now returns the object’s new status.
- “http_01” challenges now have get_path() and get_content() methods.
- “dns_01” challenges now have get_record_name() and get_record_value() methods.
- Experimental support for the “tls-alpn-01” ACME challenge.
- Most exceptions are now converted to Net::ACME::X::Generic or subclasses
thereof. The remaining plain-string exceptions “really should not happen”.
- Some unused logic (e.g., compact JWS serialization) is pruned away.
- We no longer send undef/null values to newAccount.
- Example scripts are a bit more refined.
- More substantive tests are added.
- Fix versioning issue with PAUSE. (Thanks to Dan Book for mentioning it.)
- I now consider this to be a “beta” release.
